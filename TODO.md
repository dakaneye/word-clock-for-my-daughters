## Architecture (decisions locked this session)

- **Frame is a bare shell.** All exterior features live on the back panel.
- **Buttons pressed through the back panel** (PCB tact switches are bottom-side; "Hour / Min / Audio" labels engraved next to each hole).
- **USB path: captive cable.** A 3-6 ft Micro-USB-to-USB-C cable lives permanently inside the clock, plugged into the ESP32 module's micro-USB port, exiting through a 6 mm grommeted hole at the bottom-right of the back panel. No adapter, no pigtail, no panel-mount hardware. See `docs/hardware/usb-c-breakout-removal-guide.md`.
- **Back panel removable** via 4 × M3 brass corner screws threading into hex spacers epoxied into the frame corners. Unlimited removal cycles; serves the 40-year CR2032 replacement cadence.
- **Daughterboard orientation:** DS3231 + HW-125 install with battery holder / SD slot facing the back panel (silkscreen markers on the PCB will enforce this).

## This week — blocked on parts arrival (2026-04-17)

- [ ] **Inspect AITRIP module for a polyfuse on the micro-USB VBUS input.** Magnifier-level inspection near the micro-USB connector, looking for a small yellow/green 0603/0805 component in series with VBUS. If a 500 mA polyfuse is present, bridge it with solder or bypass it before commit — the full clock draw (~700 mA typical, up to 1.5-2 A peak) will trip it otherwise. Detail in `docs/hardware/usb-c-breakout-removal-guide.md` step 3.3.
- [ ] **Caliper-measure tallest bottom-side components.** Spot-check the pinout.md table's [MED]-confidence daughterboard heights (MAX98357A, DS3231 coin-cell holder, microSD slot). Update the standoff + light-channel depth budget if any value is off by > 2 mm.
- [ ] **Pre-power smoke test protocol.** Run through `docs/hardware/pinout.md` §Pre-power smoke test: multimeter check of the USB-C breakout, DS3231 battery-charging resistor removal, MAX98357A pin sanity, then ESP32-alone flash/run, add peripherals one at a time. ~15 minutes total.

## Breadboard bring-up (after smoke test passes)

Per-peripheral isolation tests first, then the Phase 2 firmware modules that
wire everything together. See
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-14-daughters-clocks-implementation.md` §Phase 2.

- [ ] **ESP32 alone** — blink sketch. Confirms power + flashing path work on the real module.
- [ ] **I²C + DS3231** — scanner sketch finds address `0x68`.
- [ ] **MicroSD** — SPI file-listing sketch.
- [ ] **MAX98357A + speaker** — 440 Hz tone test.
- [ ] **WS2812B chain (1-3 LEDs via 74HCT245 level shifter)** — FastLED rainbow. Tests the 3.3 V → 5 V level-shift path that the PCB uses.
- [ ] **Full integration — all peripherals on one breadboard.** All Phase 2 modules (below) running together. Real de-risk before submitting the PCB.

## Phase 2 firmware modules (built during breadboard bring-up)

Phase 1 produced pure-logic modules that don't touch hardware (`time_to_words`,
`dim_schedule`, holiday/birthday triggers, grid rendering). Phase 2 is
everything that actually drives the hardware and WiFi. Modules to write:

- [ ] **`display`** — FastLED driver + the Phase 1 renderer. Applies
      `dim_schedule` multiplier, holiday palettes, birthday rainbow cycle.
- [ ] **`rtc`** — DS3231 read/write via RTClib; remove the ZS-042 battery-
      charging resistor before inserting CR2032.
- [ ] **`ntp`** — NTPClient on boot + every 6 hours; falls back to RTC if
      WiFi unreachable.
- [ ] **`audio`** — I²S + MAX98357A. MP3 decode from microSD. Play / stop
      behavior: press once to play lullaby, press during playback to stop.
      Volume is fixed in firmware and tuned during assembly.
- [ ] **`buttons`** — debounced tact-switch input on GPIO 14 / 32 / 33
      (hour / minute / audio).
- [ ] **`wifi_provision` (captive portal)** — first-boot WiFi setup. Clock
      creates a temporary open AP ("WordClock-Setup-XXXX"), serves an HTML
      form where the user picks an SSID + enters password, stores
      credentials in `Preferences` NVS, reboots onto the chosen network.
      Captive portal library: pick between **WiFiManager** (battle-tested
      but opinionated UI) and **custom + `DNSServer` + `WebServer`** (more
      control, more code). Ship decision during module implementation.
- [ ] **HTML/CSS for the captive portal form** — `firmware/data/index.html`
      (served by SPIFFS or LittleFS). Simple form: SSID dropdown (populated
      from `WiFi.scanNetworks()`), password field, submit button. Style to
      match the clock's aesthetic (warm whites, serif font); the user will
      see this once per clock during setup. Test against a mocked backend
      in a desktop browser before wiring to firmware.
- [ ] **`main.cpp` state machine** — boot → captive portal if no creds → NTP
      sync → normal clock loop, with holiday / birthday / bedtime-dim modes
      and audio button handling interleaved.
- [ ] **SD-card filesystem layout** — pick flat root with `lullaby.mp3` +
      `birth.mp3` (simplest) vs `emory/` + `nora/` subdirs (lets one card
      serve both builds during dev). Flat root wins unless we need the
      per-kid split during testing.
- [ ] **Audio file format** — pick MP3 bitrate (128 kbps VBR is fine for
      voice + a simple lullaby, tiny on a microSD). Confirm MAX98357A +
      decoder library can handle the chosen format at I²S sample rate.

## PCB finalization + order

- [ ] **Add silkscreen markers for daughterboard orientation.** Print "BATTERY →" next to `J_RTC1` and "SD →" next to `J_SD1` on the main PCB silkscreen. Prevents assembly-time orientation errors.
- [ ] **Optional: revise PCB if breadboard reveals pin conflicts or noise issues** (documented failure modes in pinout.md).
- [ ] **Re-export gerbers + drill + CPL + BOM.** Same process as `docs/hardware/kicad-rework-guide.md` step 2.11.
- [ ] **Submit to JLCPCB** for fab + assembly. 5-unit MOQ. Lead time 2-3 weeks realistic + shipping.

## 3D-printed internals (after printer calibrated + parts in hand)

- [ ] **Install build123d** (Python CAD library) for parametric part authoring.
- [ ] **PCB standoff posts (×4)** — 20 mm tall cylinders with a wider glue base, epoxied to the back panel interior at PCB corner positions. Compression-sandwich design: back-panel screws pull everything tight, PCB has no permanent fasteners. ~15 min part.
- [ ] **Button actuator caps (×3)** — tiered cylinders that slide through the 6.5 mm panel holes, bridging the ~14 mm air gap to the tact switch plungers. ~30 min part.
- [ ] **Speaker cradle** — cup with 2 mount-tab screw holes matching the speaker (~37 mm tab spacing, measure exactly from the physical part), glued to the back panel interior behind the vent. Worth printing vs gluing the speaker directly because the speakers are cheap ($2.50 each, 4-pack) while a replacement back panel is ~$50 — cradle keeps the speaker swappable without wasting wood. ~1-2 hrs to design.
- [ ] **Diffuser material test** — compare paper vs 0.5 mm frosted PETG on a single LED. Locks the light-channel depth.
- [ ] **Light channel honeycomb** — walls isolating each word's LED pocket, 35 LED pockets, snap fits to PCB, height ~18 mm. Substantial part; budget several hours of iteration. May be easier in Fusion/Onshape than scripted.

## Supplies still to order

- [ ] M3 × 10 mm brass hex spacers, 5 mm AF, F-F — 10-pack (~$8)
- [ ] M3 × 12 mm countersunk (or pan-head) brass machine screws — (~$5)
- [ ] 2-part structural epoxy (JB Weld or E6000) — (~$8)
- [ ] Micro-USB-to-USB-C cable, 3-6 ft — 1 per clock (~$6 each)
- [ ] Rubber grommet, 6 mm inner diameter (or sized to the cable OD) — (~$3)

## Assembly + validation (Emory first, then Nora)

- [ ] **Assembly plan document** — glue-up sequence, fastener BOM, adhesive choice per joint, jig notes for keeping the frame square during box-joint mating.
- [ ] **Cardboard dry-run** (optional) — ~$15 test cut to rehearse before touching real hardwood.
- [ ] **Emory unit — first light, glue-up.**
- [ ] **Emory 30-day burn-in.** Real-time calendar task — cannot be compressed. Watch for thermal, audio crackle, RTC drift, WiFi reconnection.
- [ ] **Nora unit — build with fixes baked in from Emory.**

## Parallel tracks (low-brain, re-doable, non-blocking)

- [ ] **Voice-memo recording** — Dad's voice at birth minute (6:10 PM Emory, 9:17 AM Nora). Re-recordable up to delivery in 2030 / 2032, so v1 now is fine.
- [ ] **Lullaby recording** — one song per kid. Same re-record window.

## Open questions (to resolve when the situation demands)

- Diffuser material: paper vs frosted PETG — settled by the diffuser test.
- Light channel depth vs standoff height tradeoff — tune once real component heights are measured.
- Back-panel screw-head style: countersunk vs pan-head. Drives whether we countersink the 3.2 mm panel (countersunk) or let heads sit proud (pan-head, simpler). Pick during assembly.
